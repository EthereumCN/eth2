> “We have very stringent requirements in terms of performance, privacy, and security as we are building a regulated entity operating a private blockchain to register and settle in the private and public markets. PegaSys’ blockchain offering will help us achieve scalability and finality in this stringent regulatory environment.”

After releasing v1.0 of [Pantheon](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/) in February 2019, the PegaSys protocol engineering team’s [Enterprise Ethereum](https://consensys.net/enterprise-ethereum/) client has been gaining traction in the open source blockchain space. Their latest release, 1.1, includes privacy and permissioning features as well as an improved consensus algorithm, IBFT 2.0. The PegaSys team will release [v1.2](https://pages.consensys.net/pantheon_1.2_release) on July 31st, which includes privacy improvements, permissioning UI, and EthSigner/key management. They’re gearing up for an even bigger release with v1.3 in October. From interoperability to Java tooling, here are a few reasons why Ethereum developers migrating to Pantheon.![](https://miro.medium.com/max/30/0*FSwAhIo84YShbaqe.png?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*FSwAhIo84YShbaqe.png)

## Mainnet Compatibility <a id="422c"></a>

> “LiquidShare is an industry-changing technology for equities markets and a powerful example of Ethereum’s enterprise-readiness. The collaboration with PegaSys shows the power of Pantheon, its enterprise features, and the growing interest in using an Enterprise Ethereum built for mainnet compatibility.”

Everyone hates technical debt, and every tool that you add contributes exponentially to it, while also complicating maintenance of your solution. With Pantheon, there’s no need to learn a separate mainnet and private network client. Pantheon is mainnet compatible, so for developers, learning Pantheon is enough to cover both your public and private network needs.[Safety Without Silos: Why Businesses Will Learn to Love Public Ethereum - CoinDeskJohn Wolpert leads Web3Studio, a unit of ConsenSys.

## High-Quality Documentation <a id="e317"></a>

Pantheon was designed and built [from scratch](https://media.consensys.net/why-we-rebuilt-ethereum-from-scratch-9e38b6ebd4a2), allowing us to learn from all the accomplishments and challenges of other Ethereum clients. Pantheon is accelerating time-to-market for users by leaving room to optimize for the developer experience.

The PegaSys team has also prepared [high-quality docker](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Getting-Started/Run-Docker-Image/) and cloud templates \(coming soon\) so you can spin up a node at the click of a button for testing and demonstration. These docker images are updated regularly with their latest software and serve as great demos for the product.

[PegaSys’ extensive documentation](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/) includes [quickstart guides](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Tutorials/Private-Network-Quickstart/) and [tutorials](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Tutorials/Create-IBFT-Network/) that describe the product and features in detail so you can access capabilities easily and find answers quickly. The team’s documentation also includes high-level diagrams and explanations, as well as in-detail references of new enterprise features like [privacy ](http://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Privacy/Privacy-Overview/)and [permissioning](http://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/stable/Permissions/Permissioning-Overview/).

Lastly, PegaSys’ responsive and globally distributed team is supporting users across channels––[Github](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/pantheon), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/PegaSysEng/pantheon), [email](mailto:pegasysinfo@consensys.net)––and time zones.![](https://miro.medium.com/max/30/0*YHuHyDRfjMjsVVy1?q=20)

## Enterprise-Friendly <a id="a519"></a>

> _“Treum is in the business of bringing transparency, traceability, and tradability to supply chains, using blockchain technology. Integrating with Pantheon, an enterprise optimized blockchain infrastructure, helps accelerate our mission to help businesses build trust with their customers.”_

> _–Connor Keenan, Co-Founder of_ [_Treum_](https://treum.io/)

Pantheon builds on standards specified by the world’s largest blockchain consortium, the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/), synthesizing the requirements of hundreds of different companies and dozens of industries. The PegaSys standards team is constantly feeding their expertise and learnings from Pantheon to the EEA membership and providing a feedback loop to keep their software up-to-date with the current [EEA Client Specification](http://pegasys.tech/improved-interoperability-flexible-permissioning-in-eea-v3-client-spec/).

PegaSys built Pantheon with a permissive [Apache 2.0 open source license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt) to allow enterprises full flexibility to commercialize solutions built with Pantheon. The Apache 2.0 license explicitly grants commercial permission to use, modify, and sell software under it. This applies to both copyrights and patents, unlike other open source licenses. Most legal and procurement departments will sign off on Apache 2.0 licensed software without any issues.

PegaSys invested deeply in enabling enterprises to harness the power of Ethereum through their features, free training, and regular tutorials and webinars. The team also offers developer support for PoCs and full production deployments of their software as required by many large enterprises.

## Open Source + Java Communities <a id="4aec"></a>

Pantheon is above all, an open source project, and draws inspiration from both the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/) \(EEA\) and public chain [Ethereum](https://consensys.net/knowledge-base/about-ethereum-eth/) communities. The work behind Pantheon’s features and the standards delivered are defined by both those communities’ mindsets. This includes, among other things, _identical_ EEA and mainnet Ethereum JSON-RPC APIs, allowing developers to easily switch to a single client for both use cases, without having to worry about unilateral changes.

[PegaSys](https://pegasys.tech/) speaks to one of the world’s most popular software engineering communities: Java. Java is the language of high-performance enterprise applications and an estimated 10 million developers around the world. We’re compatible with key Java tooling like JMX, Spring, Camel, and Prometheus. The team uses them on a daily basis for our work on Pantheon. If you’d like more information on why we chose Java, check out our article, [“Why Java for Blockchain.”](https://media.consensys.net/why-java-for-blockchain-73f1b444c2d)[Why Java for BlockchainHere’s why PegaSys chose Java for its new Ethereum client.media.consensys.net](https://media.consensys.net/why-java-for-blockchain-73f1b444c2d?source=post_page-----873e6f3994ef----------------------)

## Full Suite of Features: IBFT 2.0, Orion, and More <a id="a12f"></a>

Pantheon is customer-driven, and our roadmap builds towards the needs and requirements of a wide variety of users including both EEA and Ethereum Foundation stakeholders.![](https://miro.medium.com/max/30/0*m4dmyaYsCP_fhHzj?q=20)

With the help of a [Gitcoin bounty](https://gitcoin.co/) and the PegaSys community, we recently [built a GraphQL API interface implementation](https://pegasys.tech/bringing-graphql-to-pantheon-ethereal-virtual-hackathon-recap/). This is only one of the many community contributions we’re organizing to help develop some aspects of the suite. And there’s [more to come](https://gitcoin.co/explorer?org=&idx_status=open)!

Our differentiating features include the consensus algorithm [IBFT 2.0](https://pegasys.tech/another-day-another-consensus-algorithm-why-ibft-2-0/), [advanced privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8l7SSZLyFL8) \(using privacy groups and Orion\), and the most advanced and [granular permissioning in Enterprise Ethereum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD0pHtNDqZs). These privacy and permissioning features are targeted at large consortiums that have multiple people working in multiple enterprises.

Stay tuned for our guide on how to switch over to Pantheon from another Ethereum client. We’ll cover changes for APIs, key signing and implications for consensus, as well as privacy and permissioning.![](https://miro.medium.com/max/30/0*-JFDD-NsEfdo7u3L.png?q=20)
